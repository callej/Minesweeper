# Minesweeper
A small Kotlin project which is part of JetBrains Academy's Kotlin class. It is the classical minesweeper game played on a 9x9 grid.

The commands are the coordinates followed by either "mine" to mark where a mine might be or "free" to explore cells that hopefully do not have any mines.

Example:
> 3 5 mine
> 7 2 free
